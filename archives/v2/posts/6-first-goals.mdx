### Introduction

Hello üëãüèº I am a December 2020 graduate from the University of Alabama with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science. Luckily, I was able to land my first web developer job despite this chaotic time in the world. As for many people, the work environment started off from my bedroom desk, but now, we are moving into a transition time of slowly going back in the office. To prepare for this, I've documented a total of 6 goals that I set for myself in hopes to have a successful career üòè

### Compare myself to who I was yesterday, not who someone else is today

This is a no-brainer. Many developers have been a victim of imposter syndrome at some point or another. While I felt very little, if any at all, throughout my academic years, I was no different in this case. The amount of knowledge a college graduate have versus a senior developer is not even comparable. With this, it is was easy to think that I had no value to the organization but in reality, they are willing to invest in your future and therefore focus on myself. Compare myself to who I was yesterday, not who someone else is today.

### Be honest no matter who is asking

### Ask questions, when needed

### Build relationships - more than co-workers

Working remote has its pros and cons but one of my least favorite part of it was struggles building any relationships with my co-workers. The meetings were quick and short, straight to the point. But, through meeting my team for the first time and having more face-to-face interactions throughout the day, I strive to get to know my co-workers more by having more intentional conversations but also setting up environments for more casual talks using ping pongs and walks on the lake. Build relationships - more than co-workers.

### Don‚Äôt work when not working

This is an advice that I‚Äôve heard from many other developers in the past. Looking back to all 4 years of college, it seems as though I‚Äôve been unknowingly struggling with this idea for a long time and even now. After hours, I often find myself thinking on an issue that I was having during hours. I have even planned out a file and component structure for the next work day. Practically, I will be turning my computer completely off, whether I‚Äôm working remote or in person, after work, and also shut unnecessary notifications off as well for emails and teams chat. Don‚Äôt work when not working.

### Document my progress and strive to help others

This is something new I want to try. More often than not, a problem that I run into is not a unique problem that I‚Äôm facing but a problem that many others is facing or will face in the future. A community of developers on the internet is considerably large and significant. In the future, I will focus more of my free time into this community. Document my progress and strive to help others.
