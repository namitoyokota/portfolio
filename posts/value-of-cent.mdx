## Introduction

A few months ago, a friend of mine was naming different red flags for a guy. One of the red flags she mentioned was "a guy who goes out of the way to get cheap gas." I remember when I first heard that, I thought, "wait that's me."
I've been sitting on this thought for a long time. Am I being too cheap to get Sam's Club gasoline? But it saves me $2-3 each time I fill up.
This was not the first time I've been criticized for what I think is living frugally. I like to grocery shop according to how many meals I have to make. So if I need to buy groceries for 5 days, I'll get 5 yogurts and 5 bananas (one of each every morning).
When I mentioned these thoughts to my father, which he has lived a very frugal life and now is very financially well off, he hit me with this wisdom.

## Wisdom

"How much is a dollar worth to you? Is it worth picking it up from the ground? Is it worth asking a stranger? Is it worth driving a few minutes? Is it worth working 5 minutes extra? The value of a dollar is no more or less than what you're willing to give up.
A cent is the same. It's only worth what you're willing to trade it in for. But the difference is more evident looking at a cent. Because a dollar is 100 times more valuable than a cent." - Taigi Yokota

"The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imaging you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjust the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington DC instead of New York." - James Clear in Atomic Habits

So, how can I live frugally? By valuing a cent more than how others value a dollar. Than you are 100x more frugal.
