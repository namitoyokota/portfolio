-   Find the most valuable but unused item. More brand name, the better
-   Find the original product online and save the link
-   Take really good pictures with solid background color, or the item in use
-   Edit pictures to emphasize the item
-   Create a new post on Facebook. Marketplace with higher price than your idea
-   Describe how good the condition is, original product link, why youâ€™re getting rid of it, payment options
-   Negotiate and tell them your availability through DM
-   Stay strong during the trade
-   Be as honest as possible
-   Drop the price after a day to look like a discount
