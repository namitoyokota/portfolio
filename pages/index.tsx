                        At <Notation config={NotationConfigs.underline}>Venminder</Notation>, I have been leading the front-end development
                        of a web application generating 60% of company revenue. Some of my favorite contributions at Venminder are:
                    </span>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating a rich text editor in markdown format</li>
                        <li>Setting up eslint and prettier for maintaining a clean codebase</li>
                        <li>Contributing to and maintaining the internal component library</li>
                    </ul>

                    <span>
                        Before Venminder, I spent 2 years developing a highly complex public safety web product at{' '}
                        <Notation config={NotationConfigs.underline}>Hexagon</Notation>. Working on this team was one of my favorite
                        experiences due to it's advancement in the codebase. We had a micro-frontend architecture where over 40 npm packages
                        were communicating with each other without a circular dependency which then is consumed by the root repository to
                        serve the main site. Some of my favorite contributions at Hexagon are:
                    </span>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Started and deployed npm packages to share models and services between web and mobile codebase</li>
                        <li>Allowed users to find an address of the location on the map using Azure Map Service API</li>
                        <li>Constructed a hierarchical feature flag system to allow management at admin, organization, and user levels</li>
                        <li>Built an end-to-end load test tool to analyze the product performance under stress</li>
                    </ul>

                    <span>
                        Prior to Hexagon, I worked as an intern with 2 different companies: threeDays and Trips4Trade. At threeDays, I was
                        able to learn the basics of creating static websites. This internship helped me understand the importance of
                        managing a clean codebase. At Trips4Trade however, I learned a new set of tools with using WordPress. I gained
                        experience pushing changes up to different environments, refactoring existing databases, as well as using
                        third-party plugins.

                    <span>
                        In the freshman year of my high school days, I was told by the counselor that the business course I wanted to take
                        was full. Because of that, I was left with the option for 2 remaining classes: Computer Science or Piano. After
                        making the obvious choice, I fell in love with the freedom and creativity of technology and coding languages. On top
                        of that, I was good at it! So I continued to take all of the Computer Science courses that they offered and
                        eventually got an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
